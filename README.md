# Amyloid_Aggregation_Segregation_SciRep10_10127
Image analysis of cell aggregation for  Amyloid precursor protein-b facilitates cell adhesion during early development in zebrafish. Sci Rep 10, 10127 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-66584-8

The image analysis pipeline consists of (1) segmentation of the aggregates using the IJmacro
followed by (2) calculation of the S and P parameters using the MATLAB application.

Regarding the MATLAB application we can provide stand alone executables if requested.
